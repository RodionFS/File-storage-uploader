# File-storage-uploader
This simple file storage project serves my needs to upload many files from various devices through my home intranet to my PC and store them without using any cloud service. Sorry for Russian-only localization, but looking at the Java code you'll understand what any function does.
I used NetBeans 7.0.1, JDK 6, Glassfish JPS. In essence this is JSP NetBeans project.
